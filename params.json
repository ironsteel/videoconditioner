Its video generation circuit is\r\ninfamous for blatant disregard of all existing video standards at once, which makes it\r\nrather difficult to connect it to modern monitors and televisions.\r\n\r\nOutline\r\n-------\r\nThe main platform is Altera DE1 FPGA board. It is fairly outdated, but it's the one that I have\r\non my bench. Going up to more modern FPGA kits is easy.\r\n\r\nA working PAL modulator that works well in my [vector06cc FPGA\r\nreplica](https://github.com/svofski/vector06cc) of the same computer already exists.\r\n\r\nTo sample RGB + Sync video signal one needs a decent speed ADC, preferrably with 4 channels,\r\nor a special video capture chip. I found nothing that would suit the job easily available.\r\nHowever, I found out about a neat trick of using LVDS input pairs available on FPGA chips\r\nto implement custom sigma-delta ADC. No need for special chips!\r\n\r\nThe basic working principles of such ADC are described in the paper called\r\n[\"Leveraging FPGA and CPLD digital logic to implement analog to digital converters\"](http://www.embedded.com/design/configurable-systems/4008891/Leveraging-FPGA-and-CPLD-digital-logic-to-implement-analog-to-digital-converters) \r\nby Ted Marena. There's also an excellent explanation and demonstration of the principle in [One Bit ADC](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCtx9eNHXE)\r\nvideo by Jeri Ellsworth.\r\n\r\nProject structure\r\n-----------------\r\n * [hw](hw) contains KiCad files for the DE1 addon board.

It works, but is not perfect. The results on my monitor are acceptable.\r\nThere were some problems with PAL encoding that I could not resolve that I observed on a couple of older TV sets. \r\nThey are not related to the main focus of the project however: sampling video signals using nothing but a few LVDS pins.\r\n\r\nIt is definitely possible to capture low-spec video signals with a 10 year old FPGA using\r\nonly a few additional discrete components. The practical aspects of this\r\ndepend on the situation. Where reliability matter and source signal is known to be\r\nwithin the specifications, a dedicated chip\r\nlike TVP7002 would most likely do better. One interesting example of a project that uses TVP7002\r\nis [Grabor](http://www.rpg.fi/desaster/blog/2013/04/19/vga-framegrabbing-with-tvp7002/).\r\nBut with a such chip I would not be able to extract nonstandard \r\nvideo signal from Вектор-06ц, just like my monitor cannot do that. Where flexibility and fine control is\r\nrequired, being able to implement video decoding on the lowest possible level can be beneficial.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\n - [Leveraging FPGA and CPLD Digital Logic to Implement Analog To Digital Converters](/whitepapers/CreatingAnADCUsingFPGAResources.PDF) LatticeSemi Whitepaper\r\n - [Simple Sigma-Delta ADC](/whitepapers/SimpleSigmaDeltaADCDocumentation.PDF) LatticeSemi RD1066\r\n","google":"UA-3398743-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
